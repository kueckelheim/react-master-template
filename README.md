# Master React Template

A react template that combines React, Webpack, Babel, Prettier, ESLint, jest, enzyme, sass.

## Make sure the package versions in the package.json file are up to date

- use the [npm-check-updates package](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates) - updates your package.json file to latest versions
- then run npm install (Warning: includes major (code-breaking) version-updates)
